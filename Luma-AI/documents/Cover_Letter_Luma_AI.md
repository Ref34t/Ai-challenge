**Dear Luma AI Hiring Team,**

As someone who has spent 7+ years translating complex technical capabilities into user-centered products, I'm excited about the opportunity to define Luma AI's product management function during this pivotal moment in multimodal AI development.

**Why I'm the right fit for Luma's first Product Manager role:**

**Building PM Functions from Scratch**: My experience managing 10+ developers across time zones while establishing standardized processes that reduced technical debt by 30% directly aligns with your need to "define and shape the product management function." I've successfully created structure in high-growth environments where none existed.

**Technical Depth Meets User Focus**: My background gives me a unique advantage - I deeply understand both the technical complexities of AI systems and the user experience challenges they solve. Having conducted 100+ stakeholder reviews and improved usability scores by 15%, I know how to bridge the gap between cutting-edge technology and practical user needs.

**Proven Cross-functional Leadership**: Your role requires coordination between research, engineering, and design teams. I've demonstrated this by acting as a key liaison between Production and Maintenance teams, reducing project delays by 30% through improved collaboration and communication.

**Customer-Centric Product Development**: The emphasis on working "closely with users to understand their needs" resonates with my approach. I've collaborated with clients across various industries, achieving a 20% increase in satisfaction ratings by translating their creative visions into technical solutions.

**What I'll bring to Luma AI:**

- **Strategic Vision**: Ability to influence research roadmaps by integrating user insights with foundational model capabilities
- **Risk Management**: Experience identifying process gaps and leading initiatives that improve operational workflows by 20%
- **High-Agency Mindset**: Track record of driving team efficiency improvements (25%) in ambiguous, fast-moving environments
- **Technical Credibility**: Deep understanding of modern web technologies and emerging AI integrations

**Why this role excites me:**

Luma's mission to "expand human imagination and capabilities" through multimodal AI represents the future of creative technology. Having worked with creators and innovators throughout my career, I understand the transformative potential of tools like Dream Machine. The opportunity to shape how these foundational models become accessible, delightful products for artists worldwide is exactly the kind of high-impact work I'm passionate about.

I'm excited to discuss how my combination of technical depth, product leadership experience, and user-centric approach can help Luma AI continue its trajectory of building wildly successful products that empower creators.

**Best regards,**  
Mohamed Khaled

**P.S.** I've been following Luma's progress since Dream Machine's launch, and I'm particularly impressed by how you've balanced technical innovation with user accessibility. This is exactly the kind of product thinking I want to help scale.
